    <h1>Walker, Hampton</h1>
    <p>
      I am a computer science student from Birmingham, Alabama, and I have survived a brown recluse bite. My two favorite items of food are apples and pasta.
      I like to do some basic game development during my freetime, and I also like all forms of music. I'm studying computer science because I think it is a very logical topic and it is a field that grows every year.
      To be a computer scientist, you must have a desire to learn and adapt to change. I am here for the lifelong journey of knowledge, and I hope to create a few things during my time that other people will find useful.
